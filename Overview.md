VF Communicator - Application Overview (Final Revision)
Core Purpose
Create a fast, intuitive digital platform that replaces paper processes while minimizing cognitive load on workers. Every feature should prioritize speed and simplicity.
Enhanced Data Structure
javascript// User with training and lab assignments
User: {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  role: 'processor' | 'qa' | 'supervisor' | 'admin',
  assignedSupervisor?: string,
  trainedDecks: string[], // Decks user is certified to work on
  labAccess?: 'front' | 'back' | 'both', // For QA users
  subscribedDecks?: string[] // For notification filtering
}

// Batch record with lab assignment
Batch: {
  id: string,
  deckNumber: string,
  formulaNumber: string,
  batchNumber: string,
  lab: 'front' | 'back', // Which lab this batch belongs to
  
  // Status now includes 'rejected' as final state
  status:
    'mixing' |
    'qAwaiting' |
    'testing' |
    'approved' |
    'denied' |         // Requires resample
    'resampleAwaiting' |
    'rejected' |       // Final state - no resample
    'archived',
    
  rejectionReason?: string, // Required when status = 'rejected'
  
  // ... rest of fields remain the same
}
Role Capabilities
Admin (New)

Full System Access: Can perform all actions without restrictions
User Management:

Add/edit/delete users
Assign supervisors to employees
Set trained decks per user
Configure lab access for QA


No approval requirements: Direct edit capability

Processor (Updated)

Deck Restrictions: Can only create/edit batches for trained decks
Error Prevention: System blocks batch creation on untrained decks
Clear Messaging: "You are not trained on Deck X. Please contact your supervisor."

QA (Updated)

Lab-Based Views:

Front Lab Queue
Back Lab Queue
Combined Queue (Both)


No Deck Restrictions: Can test any deck in their assigned lab(s)
Active Work Only: Queue shows only batches awaiting QA

Supervisor (Unchanged)

Manages approval queue for assigned employees
Can override rejections and edits

New Features
1. Shift Report View

24-Hour Summary: All activity in last 24 hours
Flexible Filters:

By deck number
By lab (front/back/both)
By status
By user/role


Exportable: PDF format for shift handoffs

2. Historical View (All Users)

Read-Only Access: Complete batch history for all users
Infinite Scroll: Performance-optimized loading
Search Capabilities: Find specific batches quickly
No Edit Rights: Ensures data integrity

3. Rejection vs Denial Flow

Denial: Temporary state requiring resample

Status: 'denied' → 'resampleAwaiting'
Stays in active queue
Priority indicator for urgent resamples


Rejection: Final state, batch complete

Status: 'rejected' (archives immediately)
Requires rejection note (e.g., "Color off, toted off")
No resample needed/possible



User Experience Optimizations
Speed & Efficiency

Smart Defaults:

Auto-filter to user's trained decks
Remember last view preferences
Quick-action buttons for common tasks


Minimal Clicks:

Single-click status updates
Keyboard shortcuts for power users
Auto-save on all fields


Clear Visual Hierarchy:

Color-coded status indicators
Priority badges for resamples
Large, touch-friendly buttons



Error Prevention

Proactive Validation:

Check deck training before form submission
Disable invalid options
Clear error messages with solutions


Confirmation Only When Needed:

Taking over another user's batch
Final rejection (no resample)
Permanent deletions



Information Architecture

Role-Based Dashboards:

Processors: My Active Batches + Notifications
QA: Lab Queues + Testing Stats
Supervisors: Approval Queue + Team Overview
Admin: System Health + User Management


Progressive Disclosure:

Essential info visible immediately
Details available on hover/click
Full history in dedicated view



Implementation Priorities

Phase 1: Core workflow (mixing → QA → archive)
Phase 2: Admin panel + user training management
Phase 3: Shift reports + advanced filtering
Phase 4: Performance optimizations + keyboard shortcuts

This design prioritizes:

Minimal cognitive load: Workers see only what they need
Fast task completion: Common actions require 1-2 clicks
Error prevention: Invalid actions blocked before submission
Clear communication: Status and next actions always visible
